# Guidelines
- Please don't expect to use this repository as a place to spam links to your own resources. You're welcome to submit updates or documentation, but there will be an expected level of quality, and general blogspam will not be allowed.
- Organization is best-effort. If you think that your new link or documentation doesn't fit in any currently existing docs or folders, then you're more than welcome to create a new directory. If we have to reorganize in the future we will. Do not spend large amounts of time and brainpower on organization, it doesn't have to be perfect.
# How to contribute
## If you're comfortable with git
- Fork the repo
- Introduce your updates
- Create a PR from your fork to the main repo
- We'll review and merge
## If you're not comfortable with git
- Reach out to me on Discord and I'll help you get your link or documentation added to the repo. If you don't know how to already find me on Discord, your best bet is to either open an issue on the Github repo. I'll try to tend to these as soon as possible.
