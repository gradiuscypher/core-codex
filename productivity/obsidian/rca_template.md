# Root Cause

Cause 1 has been identified as the root cause.

## Explanation
Please detail your reasoning behind identifying cause 1 as the root cause.
This should be in plain English that anyone can read. 

## Verification
Here is where you would put your proof. Show us how you have validated this and how you would test for this being an issue. 

# Remediation

Recommend a remediation path, there might be multiple remediaion paths here to fix the root cause, but each one should be explained clearly 

# Prevention

List out some of the core failings in the process that might have added to the root cause, how can we prevent this issue from coming up again. The goal here is to identify how our internal process can be improved upon to ensure that issues of this class do not happen again. 

# Log Backups 

Storing relevant logs in a secondary backup site is often a good idea, as logs often get cleared out over time, however for posterity of this document we need to be sure that we can refer to these again in the future. Storing logs, and metric screenshots in an S3 bucket is a good idea. List out where you have saved each backup here.
