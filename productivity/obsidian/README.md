### Daily Note

This is a template that you can use for your daily diary notes.

It includes the following sections:

* **Tasks**:
    * **Overdue**: This is a list of tasks that are not completed and set as due before the current date.
    * **Due Today**: This is a list of tasks that have a due date of the current date.
    * **New Today**: This is where you can add all your new tasks that you run into today.
* **Meeting Log**: In this section you can list all our meetings and any notes that you have during them. I often like to tag each person that is in the meeting, and what they talked about, so that I can use this in conduction with the person template.
* **Daily Log**: I use this section to just record my thoughts and what I did throughout the day.
* **Daily Check List** This is broken up into two sections `Start of Day` and `End of Day`. These are just repeated tasks that you can do each morning.
* **Brain Dump**: This is where you can just write down anything that is on your mind, or if you want to rant about something.
* **Other Tasks**: Here you can see both all your tasks without a due date and a list of the tasks you have completed today.

### Person Template

I created this template to help me keep track of all the people that I interact with.

I have found is useful to also keep track of what people said they would do in meetings.

It will keep track of all the open tasks that include a link to the persons note, and a list of all the times that you have tagged them in a note.

### Root Cause Analysis

This is a template that you can help with you root cause analysis tasks. 

For more information please see the template, there is nothing fancy going on here, I just use this as a way to lay out my thoughts, and get me started on the process of documenting RCA.
