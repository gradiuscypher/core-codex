# core-codex
A collaborative collection of links, documentation, and interesting things. I expect this to be a mix of link collections as well as entirely new documentation. 

This repo is best viewed in Obsidian, and we might possibly include Obsidian-specific features, but there will be a strong effort to keep everything as vanilla markdown as possible.

Each directory in this repo will have a top-level `readme.md` that serves as an index to the rest of the directory, including this one. Additionally, there will be a `links.md` for each directory (or topic) where we can contribute links along with associated tags and a short description.

For contribution guidelines, please see [contributing.md](contributing.md)
