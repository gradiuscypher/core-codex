### Rough TLDR from reddit - need to confirm this after learning more
 
- Purchase the Airship or Submersible prototype 1 recipe from the schematics board. This will unlock the projects to create the parts in your company crafting log.
- Select a part to start on at the big glowy thing (sorry forgot what it's called) and set as the company project.
- Submit the materials it requires for each phase (each part has 3 phases with its own sets of mats)
- Once you finish a part, complete the project and just keep the finished part until you've made the others. Start a new project for a new part.
- Repeat until you get all the parts for one ship. Assemble, and start your voyage! You can buy ceruleum tanks from the mammet.
